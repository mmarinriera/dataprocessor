this book is largely concerned with hobbits and from its pages a reader may discover much of their character and a little of their history
further information will also be found in the selection from the red book of westmarch that has already been published under the title of the hobbit
that story was derived from the earlier chapters of the red book composed by bilbo himself the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large and called by him there and back again since they told of his journey into the east and his return an adventure which later involved all the hobbits in the great events of that age that are here related
many however may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset while some may not possess the earlier book
for such readers a few notes on the more important points are here collected from hobbitlore and the first adventure is briefly recalled
hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people more numerous formerly than they are today for they love peace and quiet and good tilled earth a wellordered and wellfarmed countryside was their favourite haunt
they do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a forgebellows a watermill or a handloom though they were skilful with tools
even in ancient days they were as a rule shy of ‘the big folk’ as they call us and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find
they are quick of hearing and sharpeyed and though they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily they are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements
they possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by and this art they have developed until to men it may seem magical
but hobbits have never in fact studied magic of any kind and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity and practice and a close friendship with the earth have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier races
for they are a little people smaller than dwarves less stout and stocky that is even when they are not actually much shorter
their height is variable ranging between two and four feet of our measure
